### *Research Case Study • Simulation Engineering • Cognitive Systems • Embedded Computing*

This repository documents the design, architecture, and frontend demonstration of a **real-time CAN bus visualization and vehicle simulation system** I developed during my research internship with the **Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC)**.

The original codebase used during the internship is **not included** (restricted).  
This public repository contains:

- A full **system architecture case study**
- **Data pipeline documentation**
- A **frontend demo** using simulated CAN data
- **Physics engine design notes**
- Engineering diagrams and high-level design
- Research context and explanation

This repo highlights my experience in **simulation engineering**, **automotive telemetry**, **real-time systems**, **cognitive science**, and **machine learning-oriented environments**.

## 🚗 Project Overview

Modern vehicles generate hundreds of real-time CAN bus signals (speed, RPM, diagnostics, throttle, steering angle). Research teams need:

- A **safe, controlled simulation environment**
- Real-time **interactive visualization tools**
- A system capable of merging **physical simulation** with **streamed sensor data**
- A platform for **autonomy research**, **HMI**, and **cybersecurity testing**

### The original prototype had

- Static, non-interactive gauge images  
- No backend capable of streaming real data  
- No simulation engine  
- No extensible architecture  

### I rebuilt the system completely

✔ Real-time physics-based vehicle simulation  
✔ Raspberry Pi CAN interface integration  
✔ WebSockets for high-speed data streaming  
✔ Interactive visualization in 2D and 3D  
✔ Unified architecture for simulation + real signals  

This repository contains the **safe public version** of that work.

All data in the demo is **artificial**.

## 📊 Data Samples (Synthetic Telemetry)

 `/data` directory contains **synthetic CAN-style telemetry datasets** used to demonstrate the system’s playback, visualization, and preprocessing pipelines.  
These files simulate realistic throttle, RPM, and timing behavior while containing **no proprietary or hardware-derived CAN frames**.
