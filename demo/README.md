**File:** `canbus-demo.mp4`

This short demo highlights the data‑processing architecture:

### What it Demonstrates

- Deterministic synthetic CAN-style data playback
- Real-time parsing of throttle + RPM signals  
- Live hex heatmap visualization  
- CLI-based record & replay engine  
- Reproducible sessions for ML and signal analysis  

Use this video to understand the underlying system behavior before signals reach the visualization or physics layers.

This upcoming demo will showcase:

### What It Will Demonstrate

- Fully rendered 3D driving world  
- High‑poly Rocket Bunny FRS/BRZ
- Real‑time vehicle physics  
- Smooth 3rd‑person → 1st‑person camera transitions  
- Interactive controller input and UI elements  

This video will emphasize the simulation side of the project and serve as a visual highlight of your engineering work.

## 📌 Roadmap: Playback‑Driven Vehicle Movement

A future milestone will integrate the playback engine with the vehicle physics system.  
This will enable:

- Real‑world → simulated driving reenactment  
- Behavior cloning datasets  
- Imitation learning  
- Offline reinforcement learning  
- Automated driving experiments  
- Synthetic dataset generation  
- Trajectory replication & debugging  

This feature is essential for the long-term **ML + Cognitive Science** research direction.
